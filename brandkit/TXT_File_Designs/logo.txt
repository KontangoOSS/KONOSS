    This is Mad Hatter Six broadcasting
    on all frequencies...
    
    The Great War between open source and
    proprietary software has ended.
    
    We won.
    
    If you're receiving this transmission,
    bring your scraps to Vault 10/6.
    We're rebuilding civilization...
    one salvaged server at a time.
    
    "Why is a mushroom cloud like a vendor?
     Both look impressive until you realize
     they've destroyed everything."
    
    Stay mad. Stay free.
    - Hatter Six, Out
