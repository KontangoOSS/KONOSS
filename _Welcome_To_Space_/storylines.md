# KONOSS: Technology Built BY Working People, FOR Working People

## Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure for the Backbone of America

---

## Executive Summary

**KONOSS (Kontango Open Source Solutions)** isn't another Silicon Valley tech company building tools they'll never use. We're blue-collar technologists who got tired of watching working businesses get priced out of modern technology. 

We built our platform in the field, alongside contractors, manufacturers, logistics companies, and the businesses that keep America running. Every feature has been tested on job sites, in warehouses, and on factory floors.

### Our Mission

**Democratize enterprise technology for working America** - because the company managing 500 trucks shouldn't pay more for software than they do for diesel.

### The Bottom Line

- **90% Cost Reduction** - More money for wages, equipment, and growth
- **Built in the Field** - Every feature tested by actual workers
- **No Tech Degree Required** - Interfaces your team can actually use
- **24/7 Support** - From people who understand your business
- **100% Open Source** - You own it, forever. No subscriptions, no surprises.

### Real Stories from Real Businesses

**Midwest Trucking Company**: 
- Paying $5,000/month for fleet management software
- Another $3,000/month for dispatch system
- $2,000/month for driver communication app
- **$120,000/year that could hire two more drivers**

**Regional Construction Firm**:
- 15 different software subscriptions
- None of them talk to each other
- Field workers need 6 apps on their phones
- **Spending more on software than equipment leases**

**Manufacturing Plant**:
- ERP system costs more than raw materials
- Need IT consultant just to run reports
- Workers bypass system, use paper instead
- **"Technology" making them less efficient**

## Our Solution: Built BY Workers, FOR Workers

### Field-Tested, Worker-Approved

We didn't build KONOSS in a Silicon Valley office. We built it on job sites, in truck cabs, and on factory floors. Every feature has been tested by the people who actually use it.

### Our Testing Process

1. **Morning Coffee Test**: Can you figure it out before your first coffee?
2. **Dirty Hands Test**: Can you use it with work gloves on?
3. **Truck Cab Test**: Does it work on a phone in a moving vehicle?
4. **End of Day Test**: Is it faster than paper at 5 PM on Friday?
5. **New Guy Test**: Can the newest hire use it on day one?

If it doesn't pass ALL these tests, we don't ship it.
